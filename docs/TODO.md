- Check disabling shadows does anything meaningful
- Add test for checkers pattern acne fix
- Check if `HitData::inside` needs to be saved
- Enforce Ray Vectors are Normalised
- Distinct type for Normalised Vectors
- Handle cone centre intersections (currently returns Zero vector)
- Use `copy` as much as possible
- Remove references where possible
- Handle obj parser errors more gracefully
- Use `Settings` struct in World instead of hardcoded magic values (e.g. recursion depth, skybox colour)
- Maybe performance: replace partial comparison + expect with total comparison when sorting `Intersections`
