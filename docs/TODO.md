- Maybe performance: replace partial comparison + expect with total comparison when sorting `Intersections` (see https://docs.rs/ordered-float/latest/ordered_float/index.html)
- Check floating point modulo operations (may need to use euclid instead)
- Check smooth triangle bounding box

- Improve project structure (fewer `mod.rs`/`test.rs` files)
- Change everything to `f32` and see what happens
