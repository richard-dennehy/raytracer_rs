- Check disabling shadows does anything meaningful
- Handle obj parser errors more gracefully
- Use `Settings` struct in World instead of hardcoded magic values (e.g. recursion depth, skybox colour)
- Maybe performance: replace partial comparison + expect with total comparison when sorting `Intersections`
- Add benchmark for Groups & CSGs to demonstrate that bounding boxes can improve performance
